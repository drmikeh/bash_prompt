bash_prompt
===========

This is a nice bash prompt that displays the time, username, host,
current working directory, and current git branch using a color
indicating the git status:

* green: clean
* red: local changes
* yellow: local repo ahead of remote

The script should be pretty self explanatory so feel free to customize it.
